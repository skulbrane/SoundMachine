If you are interested in learning electron I highly reccomend this tutorial,
it provides an excellent and comprehensive overview of the electron development
process. At the end you end up with an excellent starting point for building
on the concepts already presented.

## ToDo

* Framework
    * Build automation w/[grunt](http://gruntjs.com)
    * Refactor: lodash, modularization, error-handling, best-practices
    * Testing. Maybe mocha or jasmine

* User Features
    * Per-sound volume,pan (can we get a basic filter?)
    * Look into html5 sound features (saw oscillators in a ffdev video demo)
    * A simple sequencer would be sick
